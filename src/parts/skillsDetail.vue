      <h4>Focus on Front-end Development</h4>
      <strong>
        Main area of my expertise is front end development, everything related with this side of web. HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, etc. I love the way an awesome layout made, following the main core design theme, color, functionality and then scale to be afull website.
        <br><br>
        I have been working with wordpress and laravel but mainly in the front side since I am in college. And now I am currently focus on following JS framework and library trend. After I got the basic of the three popular JS (Angular, React, Vue), I choose to focus to go deeper with vue JS. I love this JS library more then two others, because of itâ€™s simplicity but still, you can go to more advance with this as well.
