          I am someone who passionate on building great front-end website. Creating beautiful looking website give me some satisfaction, especially when knowing that my creation is useful for someone else. For me a great UI/UX give really big impact on it’s own product. I am sure that it’s not just me, someone who choose a product or love to come back on certain website just because it’s looks good. I love to see a good design because just by see it, it can give me a lot fresh ideas to implement to my own project in the future.
